					<h2>Context</h2>
					<p> Australia struggles to spearhead rapid decarbonisation because its economy relies so much on coal.
						The Federal government demonstrates limited leadrship in this area, and therefore it is up to individul
						States to plan and execute the decarbonisation of their respective areas. One way to track their progress against
						their carbon budgets is to forecast the amount of renewable energy they expect to have from the development and running
						of Renewable Energy Assets. From analysing this, it becomes clear to us that some states are leading the charge in Australia,
						whereas others are lagging behind, with more investment and incentives required to meet their targets.</p>

					<h2> Which Australian States have the highest carbon emissions?</h2>
					<h3> Queensland (QLD), New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria (VIC) have the highest emissions and a proportionally higher responsibility to decarbonise.</h3>

				</div>
				<p>"Carbon Budgets" are an allocation of "emmittable" carbon emissions, by a company or geography, in order for that company or geography to meet their decarbonisation targets.
					Historically, all Australian States have been reliant on thermal-coal to produce power. Over time, some states have introduced renewable energy sources, such as solar, hydro and wind, to displace coal and cut down their emissions.
					By analysing the new renewable assets planned for 2022 - 2030, the displaced energy from thermal-coal generation can be calculated, revealing whether or not states will hit their Net Zero by 2050 targets.
					Note that due to the use of offsets, 2050 emissions targets are not absolute zero, but net-zero.</p>
